This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts water quality using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models. It allows users to input key water quality parameters and determines if the water is potable (safe for drinking) or non-potable.

The system is trained on historical water quality data and uses machine learning models to provide accurate predictions. The web app offers a user-friendly interface, real-time predictions, and visual cues (green for potable, red for non-potable).
